Dear reviewer, u r the first who looking on my project of trying to master a new profession of web development in part of frontend.
In this project I tried to use HTML & CSS languages.

You can download this project like zip-archive from your [yandex practicum] (https://www.practicum.yandex.ru) or in a (https://github.com/Jonsgit8/russian-travel-01) if I'll solve some problem with it.(oh, yes, I get it).

For zip-archive opening you have to push mouse's right button and chouse item of open menu **Extract files to...**

oh, easy, it's a joke, I know that you r a "big boy/gerl" and if you are reading this text you have already reached this point.

My plan of further work with this project it's make a refactoring...

*God, please stop my joking*
So, I told you the true about my plan with this progect, I was so f*cked of it, thet's why I want to forget it as soon as I can! Joke another one!
I'll try to make my code more clear as soon as I can.
